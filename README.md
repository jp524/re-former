# Odin Re-Former

Built as part of [The Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails?) curriculum: [Project: Forms](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-forms) lesson.

The goal of this project was to build forms using pure HTML and then the Rails way. New and edit forms were created for a model called User.

## Techniques Implemented
* Different types of input fields: text, email, password
* Model validation
* Routing and controller for `:new, :create, :edit, :update` actions
